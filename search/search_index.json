The App Scenario","text":"<p>Contoso Outdoors is an enterprise retailer that sells a wide variety of hiking and camping equipment to outdoor adventurers. The retailer's website has an extensive catalog of products with customers constantly asking questions and looking for information and recommendations, to make relevant purchases. The retailer decides to build a customer support agent to handle these queries right within the website.</p> <p></p> <p>Contoso Chat is the implementation of that vision, with a retail copilot backend that can be interacted with directly from the website. Customers can now ask the chatbot questions in natural language - and get back valid responses that are grounded in the product catalog and their own purchase history.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#2-the-rag-pattern","title":"2. The RAG Pattern","text":"<p>Many foundation models are trained on massive quantities of public data, giving them the ability to answer general-purpose queries effectively. However, in our app scenario we want responses based on private data from the retailer databases. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern is currently the recommended approach to solving this problem.</p> <ol> <li>The user query arrives at our copilot implementation via the endpoint (API).</li> <li>It sends the text query to a retrieval service which vectorizes it for efficiency.</li> <li>It uses this vector to query a search index for matching results (e.g., based on similarity)</li> <li>It then returns results to the copilot, potentially with semantic ranking applied.</li> <li>The copilot augments the prompt with the results, then calls the chat model.</li> <li>The chat model now generates responses grounded in the knowledge provided.</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"#3-the-app-architecture","title":"3. The App Architecture","text":"<p>Implementing this design pattern requires:</p> <ul> <li>an information retrieval service (data indexing, similarity search, semantic ranking)</li> <li>a database service for storing other data (customer orders)</li> <li>a model deployments capability (for chat, embeddings - and AI-assisted evaluation)</li> <li>a copilot hosting capability (for real-world access to deployed endpoint)</li> </ul> <p>The figure below shows the Azure application architecture for the Contoso Chat Retail Copilot, showcasing these elements. The copilot is deployed to Azure Container Apps, providing a hosted API endpoint for client integration. Requests to that endpoint are processed with:</p> <ul> <li>Azure OpenAI Services  - provides model deployments for chat and text embeddings</li> <li>Azure CosmosDB  - stores the customer order data (JSON) in a noSQL database</li> <li>Azure AI Search  - indexes the product catalog with search-retrieval capability. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The orchestration of RAG workflow steps is achieved using Prompty assets configured with relevant Azure OpenAI models and executed in a Prompty runtime (Python). This solution can support multi-turn conversations and illustrates usage of responsible AI practices (i.e., evaluation, content safety) to deliver responses that meet desired quality and safety standards.</p>"},{"location":"#4-related-resources","title":"4.

It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension</li> <li>answer: The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Run the prompty file.
